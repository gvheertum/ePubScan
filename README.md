# ePubScan

Simple tooling to analyze content of ePub files and allowing an export of the meta data of the epubs to a tabular HTML file. 

Solution contains 2 projects, 1 project for the analysis, 1 project for the catalog. The catalog will be a small ASP.NET MVC app that allows me to store the files I have and the reading status.
